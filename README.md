# Study FlashCards App

This application helps the user create and manage question sets for study. 
The app uses Room/SQLite for data storage.

# How it works: 
The Subject screen lists the available subjects. When the user selects a subject, the questions are displayed on the Question screen.
The user can cycle through the questions and show or hide the answers. 
Pressing the Up button (left arrow) in the app bar returns to the Subject screen.
